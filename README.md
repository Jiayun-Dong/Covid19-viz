# Covid19-viz (Work in Progress)

This is the demo of my recent data analysis work about visualizing Covid-19 data.
  
* `Visualizing-Covid-19-Data.md` and `[0418] Visualizing-Covid-19-Data.pdf` are the latest full-version of the analysis.
* `[0330] Visualizing-Covid-19-Data.pdf` is an earlier version.
* `Visualizing-Covid-19-Data.Rmd` contains the code to generate the analysis.

I also summarize the key take-away below (Coming soon! Please refer to the full version for now.). Please let me know your comments and suggestions.
